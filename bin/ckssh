# This is the pure(-ish) side of ckssh-add, designed to be
# unit-tested.  It should have as much of the logic as possible.
#
# The return value is 0 or the error code of any untested command
# within (because we set the `-e` option for this shell script).
#
# The function has the following (actually impure) results:
#
# * We may exit the process with an error; we do this here because
#   it's too hard in shell to return an error message along with
#   the error indication of the numeric return value. (These parts
#   are tested in fuctional tests.
#
# * The return value is 0 if no untested commands failed internally.
#
# * It changes the `keyfiles` global variable to be the list of files
#   from which keys should be added by the subsequent
#   `execute_ckssh_add` call.
